# Drum-Kit
This is a website in which you can play drums both using buttons(mouse-touch) as well as keys (by pressing the alphabet key of your system written on the button), I've used HTML, CSS  and JavaScript in this website. I've used some advanced concepts of javascript like switch statements for setting the correct music for correct button,  concepts of objects and their methods, event listeners and animations, have a look, you'd love it   :)
