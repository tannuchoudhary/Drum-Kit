# Drum-Kit
This is a website in which you can play drum-kit both using buttons(mouse-touch) as well as keys, I've used HTML, CSS  and JavaScript. I've used some advanced concepts of javascript like switch statements for setting the correct music for correct button,  concepts of objects and their methods, event listeners and animations, have a look, I hope you'll love it   :)
